# Simon Game
![gamescreen](simongame.png)
## Welcome
>Welcome to the wonderful world of **SIMON**. This game was created in the the style of the original Simon handheld game, originally released in *1978*.
Simon is a game to test your memory, once the game has started the computer will randomly light up one square and then the player should try and guess the same square to click. Check your sequence to see if your play matched the computer generated choice. If you are correct play can continue with the computer adding one more random square to the sequence each level. The play is endless, unless the player chooses the wrong square in the sequence, then the game is over with the option to replay. To play my version of Simon check out this link [Simon](https://imupallnighttogitsome.github.io/Project-1-GA/#).

## User Stories
- As a player,  you are able to watch a computer screen button light up, so that when it's my turn I can click the same button.
- As a player, you are able to watch the computer light up a series of buttons accumulating one new light up at a time, so that play can go back and forth as long as I am able to mimic the computers choices in the correct order.
- As a player, you are able to see a running score of my winning streaks.
- As a player, you have unlimited time to make my next choice in the series.
- As a player, if you choose the wrong button the game can restart at one light so I can play again.
## Major Hurdles and Unresolved
- Struggled with overlapping of my buttons which led to functionality issues.
- Was not able to implement a function to check the users' clicks in real time against the computer generated pattern.
- Was not able to have the computer automatically move forward to the next turn after the player has made the correct number of choices.
